in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep ¡§i¡¦m sorry¡¦ he said finally ¡¥about the other night i never wanted to ¡K well it was badly judged¡¦i shook my head i couldn¡¦t speak any more¡¥i didn¡¦t sleep with her if you won¡¦t hear anything else i do need you to hear that¡¦¡¥you said ¡V¡¦he looked up¡¥you said ¡K nobody would ever hurt me again you said that when you came to new york¡¦ my voice emerged from somewhere in my chest ¡¥i never thought for a moment you would be the one to do it¡¨and sam just lets her go just as he tried to keep her without passion no one really listens to louisa in her life her boyfriend her family hell maybe even will when he was alive no one appreciates her for who she is not really lou later dates josh who again tries to change her she accommodates him changing her style trying to fit into

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep ¡§i¡¦m sorry¡¦ he said finally ¡¥about the other night i never wanted to ¡K well it was badly judged¡¦i shook my head i couldn¡¦t speak any more¡¥i didn¡¦t sleep with her if you won¡¦t hear anything else i do need you to hear that¡¦¡¥you said ¡V¡¦he looked up¡¥you said ¡K nobody would ever hurt me again you said that when you came to new york¡¦ my voice emerged from somewhere in my chest ¡¥i never thought for a moment you would be the one to do it¡¨and sam just lets her go just as he tried to keep her without passion no one really listens to louisa in her life her boyfriend her family hell maybe even will when he was alive no one appreciates her for who she is not really lou later dates josh who again tries to change her she accommodates him changing her style trying to fit into the model of a corporate girlfriend to me louisa loses her sense of individuality when she is coupled off with a man doing whatever she can to sate and please him

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the

its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep

better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she cont  long review ahead read at your own discretion i do sincerely hope jojo moyes reads this i understand me before you has a fond place in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the
