in many peoples heart im sure most have heard or seen its movie make in the entirety of the series i can truthfully say this is the most unfulfilling saddening book because it has done an injustice to its protagonist louisa clark deserves better across these books its impossible not to notice that she has the kindest most selfless heart yet she continues to fall in love with selfish men men who ultimately are charming but in likeness are also bullies her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride and her own sense of selfs value to be stomped onme before you revolves around louisa becoming the companion of will traynor a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state what initially begins as a hateful employeremployee relationship slowly transforms into friendship and later love until we come to a penultimate ending where will commits euthanasia it was the rawest book i have ever read saying that i was not blind to wills flaws and the way he incessantly reminded louisa that she was this small town girl who simply had to live whereby his definition of living included an exploration of the world yes louisa blossomed under new experiences but there was an almost manipulative quality to the way he would push her sometimes as if should she not strive for all these new things with this potential he has noticed in her then she simply accepts to being a no body theres an emphasis on how louisa would never be an object of lust  i say the word object loosely but rather one of love someone who you dont take notice of instantaneously but mould in order to love he fit her into a brighter new shiny model of louisa clark it seemed to me no one accepts lou as she is me after you begins eighteen months after wills suicide louisa is stuck in a spiral of grief unable to grasp her footing on how she will fulfil the promise she made to will the promise to live and experience new things the shift in herself only begins after she unexpectedly meets the sixteen year old daughter will never knew he had and somewhere amongst the chaos she begins to date a paramedic named sam quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book in still me louisa finally sets off in search for an adventure in new york with a new job shes bright eyed and positive and fearless i admire lous fearlessness shes not home sick yet there is an acute loss of the people in her life and a homely atmosphere ¡§you always have one foot in two places you can never be truly happy because from the moment you leave you are two selves and wherever you are one half of you is always calling to the other this is our price louisa this is the cost of who we are¡¨the long distance relationship between herself and sam has become a strain no one puts in effort with louisa and they only do once they have lost her and suddenly see her value it is quite possibly the most real and disheartening thing to read about she begged sam in the first three months of her move that he write her emails and letters and update her on all the small bits of his life so they are still there for one another but hes very dismissive of her wishes and puts little to no emotional effort in their relationship instead when he comes down to visit her he pushes blame that she has left him and changed in this new place it seemed he was determined to sour any of the time they did spend together he doesnt appreciate any of the small things she does to keep him in her life and it was this very ignorance that made me resent him because it is the recipe to a relationship ending instead lou learns he has a new female partner at work and as information filters through alongside what can only be called a womans intuition lou knows this lady named kate clearly is into sam yet when louisa announces her feelings sam blows up at her instead he gets jealous over a man named josh who was helpful when she was stuck in a tricky situation a man who resembles will in looks only lou who cuts josh off out of deference to sam once she realises that he bothers him yet he does not pay her the same curtesy instead he goes out with katie to bars they take close body to body pictures they have drinks he goes over to her flat fixing her wardrobe spending working hours in the company of a woman who is interested is almost understandable yet spending nonworking hours in the company of a woman who you know bothers your girlfriend clearly shows you do not respect her wishes those are not the actions of a boyfriend but of a man looking for the opportunity to cheat when louisa returns earlier than expected for christmas and plans to surprise sam she witnesses this¡§she walked across the carriage saying something unclear her voice muffled by the glass her hair clipped up and tumbling in soft curls around her face she was wearing a man¡¦s tshirt ¡V his ¡V and holding a wine bottle and i saw him shake his head and then as he bent over the stove she walked up behind him and placed her hands on his neck leaning towards him and rubbing the muscles around it with small circular motions of her thumbs a movement that seemed born of familiarity her thumbnails were painted deep pink as i stood there my breath stalled in my chest he leant his head back his eyes closed as if surrendering himself to her fierce little handsand then he turned to face her smiling his head tilted to one side and she stepped back laughing and raised a glass to him¡¨this is one of the points when i respected lou because she breaks it off in one sweep ¡§i¡¦m sorry¡¦ he said finally ¡¥about the other night i never wanted to ¡K well it was badly judged¡¦i shook my head i couldn¡¦t speak any more¡¥i didn¡¦t sleep with her if you won¡¦t hear anything else i do need you to hear that¡¦¡¥you said ¡V¡¦he looked up¡¥you said ¡K nobody would ever hurt me again you said that when you came to new york¡¦ my voice emerged from somewhere in my chest ¡¥i never thought for a moment you would be the one to do it¡¨and sam just lets her go just as he tried to keep her without passion no one really listens to louisa in her life her boyfriend her family hell maybe even will when he was alive no one appreciates her for who she is not really lou later dates josh who again tries to change her she accommodates him changing her style trying to fit into the model of a corporate girlfriend to me louisa loses her sense of individuality when she is coupled off with a man doing whatever she can to sate and please him yet this behaviour does not extend to herself from her partner and only when sam learns that she is dating josh does he begin to write letters wanting her back after months and do you know what that showed me as a reader that he was more concerned about a prospective man and louisas attention and life moving further away than he was preoccupied with her and who she is i suppose he did end up with katie and it didnt work out but the situation wasnt explained there at all other than a few short sentences in a letter¡§i¡¦m not with katie i wasn¡¦t when i last saw you i don¡¦t want to say too much but it became clear pretty quickly that we are very different people and that i had made a huge mistake if i¡¦m honest i think i knew it from the start¡¨it wasnt a mistake it was sacrilege and if lou had any pride she wouldnt have given him a second chance only at the end does louisa take control of her life and go after a career that truly makes her happy the return of sam and their reunion was the possibly worst ending for me it was a grave injustice to the spark that is louisa clark she should have left him and his fucking fuckery self behind looking towards the future not having to continuously rely or need a man but being her own independent loveable self she never needed sam or josh she just needed the catalyst that was will  more

dejo muy contrariadasupero las cero expectativas que tenia jajaja pero no estara en mi top de favoritos de este anosigo pensando que solo se debio quedar en yo antes de tien este libro vemos a nuestra querida louisa clark mudarse a la ciudad de nueva york para ser la asistente de una acaudalada joven de la alta sociedad una persona de la alta sociedad que no es muy querida por otros en sus circulos sociales ya que su esposo estuvo casado con su amiga una amiga de la que se divorcio para casarse con su masajista mucho mas joven antes de que ella supere su jet lag louisa esta corriendo en central park yendo de compras y asistiendo a eventos sociales de lujo ella se ve inmersa en una vida glamorosa que es muy diferente de la vida que vivio en inglaterra con su novio paramedico sammientras se encuentra con un hombre llamado josh ryan que se parece mucho a alguien de su pasado forma una amistad mientras louisa esta enamorada de sam y se lanza al circulo social de la alta sociedad de nueva york louisa sigue siendo peculiar y se encuentra en diversas situaciones tanto comicas como tristes habra malentendidos nuevos amigos corazones rotos falta de comunicacion engano y caosen totalidad de la trilogia puedo decir con sinceridad que este es el libro mas insatisfactorio y entristecedor porque ha sido una injusticia para su protagonista louisa clark se merece algo mejor a traves de estos libros es imposible no darse cuenta de que ella tiene el corazon mas bondadoso y desinteresado sin embargo ella continua enamorandose de hombres egoistas los hombres que en ultima instancia son encantadores pero a la semejanza tambien son desgraciados su desinteres es su perdicion porque deja atras su orgullo y su propio sentido del valor de si misma para ser pisoteada la relacion de larga distancia entre ella y sam se ha convertido en una linea de alta tension no se esfuerza con louisa y solo lo hace una vez que la ha perdido y de repente ve su valor es muy posiblemente lo mas real y desalentador sobre lo que leer ella le suplico a sam en los primeros tres meses despues de su mudanza que le escribiera correos electronicos y cartas y que la pusiera al dia sobre todos los detalles de su vida para que asi siguieran estando el uno para el otro pero el es muy desdenoso de sus deseos y pone poco o ningun esfuerzo emocional en su relacion en cambio cuando va a visitarla le echa la culpa de que ella lo ha dejado y cambiado en este nuevo lugar parecia que estaba decidido a echar a perder todo el tiempo que pasaron juntos  l no aprecia ninguna de las cosas pequenas que ella hace para mantenerlo en su vida y fue esta misma ignorancia lo que me hizo aborrecerlo porque es la receta para el final de una relacion en cambio lou descubre que tiene una nueva companera en el trabajo y cuando la informacion se filtra junto con lo que solo puede llamarse la intuicion de una mujer lou sabe que esta dama llamada kate claramente esta interesada en sam pero cuando louisa anuncia sus sentimientos sam explota en cambio se pone celoso por un hombre llamado josh que fue util cuando ella estaba atrapada en una situacion delicada un hombre que se parece a will lou que se aleja de josh por respeto hacia sam una vez que se da cuenta de que el le molesta sin embargo el no le da la misma cortesia en lugar de eso sale con kate a bares se toman fotos juntos beben va a su piso para arreglar su guardarropa pasa horas de trabajo en compania de una mujer que esta interesada es casi comprensible sin embargo pasar horas no laborales en compania de una mujer que usted sabe molesta a su novia muestra claramente que no respeta sus deseos esas no son las acciones de un novio sino de un hombre que busca la oportunidad de hacer trampanadie realmente escucha a louisa en su vida su novio su familia tal vez incluso will cuando estaba vivo nadie la aprecia por lo que ella es realmente no lou luego sale con josh quien nuevamente intenta cambiarla ella cambia su estilo tratando de encajar en el modelo de una novia corporativa para mi louisa pierde su sentido de la individualidad cuando esta emparejada con un hombre haciendo todo lo que puede para saciarlo y complacerlo sin embargo este comportamiento no se extiende a si misma de su pareja y solo cuando sam se entera de que ella esta saliendo con josh comienza a escribirle cartas pidiendole que regrese despues de meses <U+00BF>y sabes lo que me mostro como lectora que estaba mas preocupado por un posible hombre en la vida de louisa que por la misma louisa no fue un error fue un sacrilegio y si lou tuviera algo de orgullo no le habria dado una segunda oportunidad solo al final louisa toma el control de su vida y persigue una carrera que realmente la hace feliz el regreso de sam y su reunion fue posiblemente el peor final para mi fue una grave injusticia para la chispa que es louisa clark deberia haberlo terminado definitivamente mirar hacia el futuro no tener que depender continuamente de un hombre sino ser un propio ser independiente y adorable ella nunca necesito a sam ni a josh ella solo necesitaba el catalizador que era willen este libro louisa toma el consejo de will de yo antes de ti solo obtienes una vida de hecho es su deber vivirla lo mejor posible se arriesga y hasta el final trata de ser la persona que en realidad desea pero lamentablemente creo que no lo consigue del todo fue un libro de 35 estrellas para mi esperaba que fuera mejor no puedo culpar a jojo por escribir mas de lou su escritura es buena pero la historia se hundio en algunas partes para mi de nuevo creo que deberia haberse quedado en yo antes de ti  more

fig about the story or author beyond the blurb i loved it i cried buckets i thought about it for days afterwards it wasn¡¦t until a year or so later that i became aware of ¡¥own voices¡¦ reviewers who were pulling apart the toxicity and ableism in the story and then really honing in when news of a film adaptation became even more problematic that was also part of my reluctance to read second book ¡¥after you¡¦ ¡V not just because a sequel some four years after the first book was released and clearly designed to cashin on the movie coming out but also because i now had blinkers off to the problems thankfully ¡¥after you¡¦ fully avoided the traps of the first book and leaned into being a universal story of living with grief and all that that entails ¡V including falling in love again i really enjoyed it and given the somewhat cliffhanger emotional ending i was excited to discover jojo moyes bringing a third instalment ¡¥still me¡¦ ¡V which follows lou clark after moving to new york for a new job and thus beginning her new relationship with paramedic sam as a longdistance one it took me two days to read this and then on the home stretch i stayed up until 2am to finish now that¡¦s not necessarily because it was so amazingly brilliant but because i¡¦m experiencing a slight new year reading malaise and can¡¦t really get started or stuck into anything ¡K until ¡¥still me¡¦ came along it is not a brilliant book and is certainly a pail in comparison to my enjoyable reads of the first and second instalments but i needed to know how it would all end because lou clark has truly grown on me stripey leggings and all lou¡¦s new job in new york supplied by physical therapist friend nathan involves being a companion of sorts to a rich new york wife called agnes gopnik who is struggling to adjust to her role as second wife amidst the glitz glamour and fundraiser events her husband¡¦s role require she attend agnes is also originally from poland and missing her family

different caregiver role lou is also missing her new boyfriend sam ¡V who she had been with for only a few months before he urged her to take this job of a lifetime but there¡¦s every indication that their new relationship can weather the storm of a year apart considering the extraordinary circumstances that bought them together ¡V sam grieving his dead sister lou grieving for will traynor ¡V and then sam getting gravely injured while out on a job all of which has seen them fall fast and hard for one another the lou in new york storyline is seriously lacklustre agnes gopnik is a character sadly made of cliches right down to the pigeonenglish dialogue she spouts her story is clearly built up to be something more than i certainly felt as a reader ¡K and while moyes tries a doover with another character to pull on lou¡¦s heartstrings this one felt like a slightly maddening uturn and never quite landed an emotional punch i wish we¡¦d gotten more sam but predictably the fact that we don¡¦t is kinda the whole point but i still feel like there¡¦s more to know about him and there were so many times in the book where for the sake of an adrenaline injection in the staid story i wished lou would lean into confrontation and tackle situations headon the fact that she doesn¡¦t repeatedly leaves the novel with a feeling of a held breath and even by the end i still felt there was a lot left unsaid that needed to be aired if this was to be the last instalment the other negative of ¡¥still me¡¦ is the memory of will traynor awkwardly shoehorned in for relevancy i thought ¡¥after you¡¦ was going to be a trainwreck when it was revealed that will had a surprise lovechild but that storyline worked well in this book will¡¦s spectre comes in the form of two or three old letters he wrote during his time in new york and also ¡V a lookalike american who gives lou pause josh is another awkward shoehorn but there was some purpose to his presence which was i thought to show lou that had will never had his accident ¡V he probably would have kept on being an entitled banking prat who¡¦d have never given her and her wacky style a secondglance ugh this book was ¡K fine hovering somewhere

5,                          oh wow i don¡¦t even know where to start is it possible to read and finish a jojo moyes novel without tears streaming down your face at least with still me they were tears of pure joy and happiness louisa clark i love you whereas others have questioned why louisa¡¦s story has been continued i have loved both continuations of her story and still me was an even more enjoyable and perfect read than after you honestly if you are yet to continue louisa¡¦s story and you loved me before you you  oh wow i don¡¦t even know where to start is it possible to read and finish a jojo moyes novel without tears streaming down your face at least with still me they were tears of pure joy and happiness louisa clark i love you whereas others have questioned why louisa¡¦s story has been continued i have loved both continuations of her story and still me was an even more enjoyable and perfect read than after you honestly if you are yet to continue louisa¡¦s story and you loved me before you you simply have to read them still me continues where after you ended with lou moving to new york to take up residence in a fifth avenue apartment as an assistant nathan also works there and oh what a joy it was to meet him again not just because thanks to the film of me before you i could picture him as brax from home and away but because it was the first of many connections to will will is present through the whole of this story as lou is living her life the way that he wanted her to and it was a pure joy to read jojo moyes is a fantastic comedic writer and the opening to this story was just laugh out loud funny again more so because we can picture the wonderful emilia clarke as lou i loved seeing new york through her eyes her fear excitement and apprehension and how she soon became caught up in this very different world from that which she was used to the journey that louisa goes on throughout this story is where it really shines i thought about the young naive girl we first met back when she was going to meet will and mrs traynor for the first time and compared that with the louisa we see at the end of still me and there¡¦s a world of difference she still struggles and lacks some confidence at the start of the story but watching her grow and develop as the story progressed filled me with both envy and pride at seeing this she has left ambulance sam back home and soon the struggles of a longdistance relationship make themselves known not helped by the fact that louisa bumps into somebody that bears a striking resemblance to somebody from her past in the beginning i was torn about louisa¡¦s relationship but as the story progressed there was only one way i wanted this story to end i felt at times there may have been an element of things falling into place a little too perfectly for louisa but this is fiction and i love this series and was able to overlook that and just enjoy the story for what it was after all this book is not without heartache or its struggles for louisa we see her return to the uk a few times and one of those times really effected me emotionally because it reminded me of when i lost a loved one louisa¡¦s time in new york is fantastic to read and her escapades are a whole lot of fun jojo moyes shows us all sides of this amazing city and i loved following and feeling like i was alongside louisa there¡¦s so many developments in this story and i want to talk about them all but whereas i usually get carried away and talk and talk and talk the best thing i can say is read this book read it live it and love it just as i have done over the past few days i remember the day i picked up me before you on a whim i remember the day i finished it lying in a freezing cold bath with tears pouring down my face i have read hundreds of books since and me before you remains in my memory quite vividly i remember reading after you and falling in love with louisa even more and then i remember crying at the trailer for the film of me before you and bawling at the actual film books like this are why i read unforgettable stories with unforgettable characters that offer pure escapism i am bereft to have finished this story and will now have one of the worst book hangovers i think i¡¦ve ever had i didn¡¦t want the story to end and i didn¡¦t want to leave these characters behind in case it wasn¡¦t clear by this point i cannot recommend this book or series enough thank you jojo moyes for continuing louisa¡¦s story not once but twice and for doing it so perfectly   more                  
4,                          oh man this book was just absolutely brilliant i know a lot of readers felt as if it was the end for them with me before you and honestly i felt like that too i felt as if i was betraying will and his memory by continuing this journey with lou but just like will lou was such a big character that i wanted to go on following her to experience her journey with her once again it wasnt smooth sailing for louisa she had got an incredible opportunity to stay and work in new york the city t  oh man this book was just absolutely brilliant i know a lot of readers felt as if it was the end for them with me before you and honestly i felt like that too i felt as if i was betraying will and his memory by continuing this journey with lou but just like will lou was such a big character that i wanted to go on following her to experience her journey with her once again it wasnt smooth sailing for louisa she had got an incredible opportunity to stay and work in new york the city that never sleeps she had the chance to explore new things and become her own person it was what will would have wanted right it took me a while to warm up to the gopniks the family that louisa would be staying with they were completely loaded and so i really wanted lou to take note of what nathan was saying just because you were working for them and had become mrs gopniks friend it didnt mean that they couldnt get rid of you when they felt like it also i wasnt the biggest fan of mrs gopnik i really couldnt understand her at times i know that she did find herself in a tough situation with no real support system but i just couldnt stand her and then when the big turn of events did come around i knew my gut feeling of not being able to trust her had been right all along but as they say one friendship lost is another gained right so i was thrilled that lou was able to find a confidant in the least expected of places once again with still me lou had a lot to learn and discover who did she want to be and want with life were daily struggles for her and with things being all over the place with sam i could see how it could be a confusing time with lou i at times didnt know what would be the right path for lou to take but again i loved how despite her struggles lou didnt quit and go home she pushed through having her life being turned upside down overnight and walked around with a smile on her face and this is what i love the most about lous character things may have hit the fan but lous resilience and attitude always bolsters her i know if i was in lous shoes id just want to stay in bed all day and never get up but things werent always doom and gloom there was of course lous family who were a delight to be back with again with their witty personalities and charm they bought so much fun and laughter to the story and of course there was lou herself who probably without realising it bought so many laugh out loud moments still me wasnt without a great set of new characters they were vivacious bubbly and absolutely charming every time moyes brings in characters that you cant just help but love and want to be around lou really has come a long way in still me from the girl that we first met in me before you thank you ms moyes for giving us the chance to experience such an incredible journey with such a wonderful person as lou  more

3,                          as many of you know i have been a huge fan of jojo moyes novels for quite some time i loved the first book in this series me before you and many of her other books have indeed been my guilty pleasure over the yearsso for me me before you did not need a sequel or to be made into a series for me it ended on a high note and i didn¡¦t think that it needed to be followed up by any more books which is why i didn¡¦t really want to read after you in fact i didn¡¦t read the second book in this serie  as many of you know i have been a huge fan of jojo moyes novels for quite some time i loved the first book in this series me before you and many of her other books have indeed been my guilty pleasure over the yearsso for me me before you did not need a sequel or to be made into a series for me it ended on a high note and i didn¡¦t think that it needed to be followed up by any more books which is why i didn¡¦t really want to read after you in fact i didn¡¦t read the second book in this serieswhich begs the question why did i pick this one up honest answer i haven¡¦t read a jojo moyes novel in a while and i was in the mood to linger over the writing style and romances i felt starved for a moyes novel and jumped at this oneso i committed a most grievous error by picking this book up without reading the second book after you i should definitely have read after you first it was clear that i was missing key pieces to the narrative i did decide to keep reading though because moyes story telling ability commands it she tells a fabulous romance story and once you start it¡¦s hard to put her novels downas i mentioned earlier i didn¡¦t think that louisa clark needed anymore ¡¥story¡¦ once me before you ended but i can see why readers would want to know more about her and what happened after readers got to know lou on such a visceral level in me before you that having her story end and be over in the one book might have seemed unfinished to some readers for me it was fine where it was at the end of book 1 but i can see why others might want to know morein this book lou is a much different character than in the first book though i missed key plot points and character developments by skipping book 2 i could still see and appreciate her growth as a main character she is like meeting an old friend though she is much different now her core traits make her feel like meeting a friend you haven¡¦t seen in a long time¡Xwhile it¡¦s clear things have changed the person is still fundamentally the same i like that about lou it makes her seem personable and easy to love and care about as a main characterthe story itself for me fell short how do you follow up such a magnificent novel like me before you you just don¡¦t this book had great writing and the plot was fine but for me it lacked the same magic that the first book had it was good but not as great as me before you i liked the plot and getting to get reconnected with lou but it just lacked the same sparkle that the first book hadthough i found some things to be wanting in the narrative the writing was beautiful i would expect nothing less from moyes and every time i read one of her books she delivers on the writing and romance some books are better than others but i am generally never disappointed and that¡¦s how i felt with this book i liked it but i didn¡¦t love itsee my full review here  more

abschluss ihrer geschichte der mich wirklich glucklich gemacht hatwas jojo moyes bucher fur mich jedesmal so besonders macht vor allem deswegen weil ich normalerweise gar keine typischen frauenunterhaltungsromane mehr lese ist ihr schreibstil und ihre fahigkeit so ehrliche und authentische figuren aus dem boden zu stampfen geschichten zu erzahlen die real aber dennoch irgendwie ausergewohnlich sind gerade lou ist eine protagonistin zu der ich einfach so gerne zuruckkehre moglicherweise etwas naiv aber dennoch so liebenswert und offen und aufrichtig  ber sie zu lesen fuhlt sich einfach so an als wurde man eine alte freundin wiedertreffen man kann gar nicht anders als sie in sein herz zu schliesen auch dieses mal hat moyes mich wieder total erwischt ¡V ich glaube ich habe noch nie fur ein buch von ihr langer als zwei tage gebraucht sie vermag es einfach ihre geschichten so zu schreiben und zu erzahlen dass man das buch nicht weglegen kann es wird nie langweilig lous leben ¡V und auch das ihrer restlichen familie an dem wir auch in diesem band teilhaben durften ¡V ist ein auf und ab an gefuhlen und situationen aber es passiert auch nie zu viel dass man den kopf schuttelt und das gelesene als unrealistisch abstempeln wurde ich weis nicht wie sie es macht aber das tempo und die art und weise in der sie ihre romane strukturiert und uns erzahlt ist einfach ganz besonders und wird mir nie langweilig im gegenteil ¡V ich war richtig traurig als <U+201E>mein herz in zwei welten¡§ zu ende war und lous geschichte damit jetzt tatsachlich komplett zu ende istaber nicht alles ist rosarote zuckerwattewolke es gab an diesem roman zwar nichts was mich wirklich so richtig storte aber dennoch ¡V einige wendungen waren meiner meinung nach irgendwie doch zu konstruiert und vorhersehbar es war aufregend lou in new york zu begleiten und ich konnte sie mir richtig vorstellen wie sie in ihrem ausgefallenen stil und ihrer offenherzigen art durch diese hektische und laute stadt spazierte und alles um sich herum aufsog und beobachtete ich mochte auch gar nichts weiter uber die handlung verraten weil ich absolut nichts vorwegnehmen mochte aber einige situationen und handlungen waren dann irgendwie doch aus dem romantikfundus ausgeliehen was das buch nicht zu einem schlechteren macht ¡V nur eben ein klitzekleines bisschen unoriginellerschon nach ankundigung des zweiten teils gab es viel kritik daruber warum die geschichte um lou und will so ausgeschlachtet wird ich verstehe die denkweise bin aber der auffassung dass schon <U+201E>ein ganzes halbes jahr¡§ nicht die geschichte von lou und will war sondern nur die von lou insofern gefallt mir der gedanke sehr dass wir sie weiter begleiten durften noch so viele facetten von ihr kennenlernen durften und sehen konnten wie sie nach einem so schweren schicksalsschlag wieder ins leben und vor allem zu sich selbst fand mich haben die bucher alle sehr geruhrt ¡V der erste band wird immer einen besonderen platz in meinem herzen haben aber gerade dieser dritte abschliesende teil hat sich fur mich einfach wahnsinnig gut und richtig angefuhlt und ich bin froh dass die geschichte von lou so wunderbar zu ende erzahlt wurdeein kleines problem hatte ich mit der sprache bzw der  bersetzung an zwei stellen moglicherweise bin ich in der hinsicht einfach etwas uberempfindlich aber ich stose bei dem satz <U+201E>jedem das seine¡§ einfach sofort negativ auf weil genau diese worte gros uber dem kz buchenwald hingen ich weis dass die aussage in dem kontext in dem sie in <U+201E>mein herz in zwei welten¡§ verwendet wurde absolut nicht so gemeint war und denke auch dass das bewusstsein wie dieser satz im historischen kontext genutzt wurde nicht bei jedem da ist aber ich wollte es dennoch gesagt haben eben weil der satz bei mir sofort diese assoziationen hervorrief und ich mir denke dass man genau diese aussage auch in hundert andere worte packen kannlouisas leben hat mich auch im dritten teil der trilogie begeistern konnen es war wieder einmal eine achterbahnfahrt der gefuhle wie macht jojo moyes das und ich bin unendlich froh dass ich lou auf ihrem abenteuerlichen weg durchs leben zur seite stehen durfte in meinen augen hatte die reihe nicht wurdevoller und besser abschliesen konnen ¡V ich werde lou und vor allem auch ihre familie sehr vermissen  more

4,                          very enjoyable end to the series ties up a lot of loose ends that the second book after you left undone                  
4,                          so it took me a good third of the book to get into it once i did i was hooked this book made me laugh cry become angry become happynot necessarily in that order lol i love louisa clark and hope that there will be another book as im not ready for her story to end                  
4,                          i received a copy of still me from penguin random house new zealand to review this is the third book in the me before you series i¡¦ve enjoyed all three books in this series i was only ever expecting there to be one book me before you and it¡¦s still my favourite of the three but i do like the other two as welli love lou she¡¦s just so uniquely herself and i love reading about her outfits even though i¡¦m not into fashion at all i also love her family especially her parents i think they¡¦v  i received a copy of still me from penguin random house new zealand to review this is the third book in the me before you series i¡¦ve enjoyed all three books in this series i was only ever expecting there to be one book me before you and it¡¦s still my favourite of the three but i do like the other two as welli love lou she¡¦s just so uniquely herself and i love reading about her outfits even though i¡¦m not into fashion at all i also love her family especially her parents i think they¡¦ve made me laugh out loud in every booki was really looking forward to seeing what lou got up to in new york city because knowing her luck it wouldn¡¦t be smooth sailing i wasn¡¦t expecting anything bad to happen but still i mean she had fallen off a roofthere was one thing i didn¡¦t like about still me and its big part of why i couldn¡¦t give the book five stars i felt like the will traynor doppelganger was a bit much and completely unnecessary the story could have done without it it just felt like a way to keep will in lou¡¦s story and there was already a pretty good way he was connected to her time in new york without this guy¡K so i don¡¦t get why josh needed to look like will i just wish that one detail wasn¡¦t in it i mean she couldn¡¦t even introduce him to people who knew will without thinking she¡¦d be judged i just don¡¦t get why he was even needed in thisanyway lou and her family definitely made up for it oh and a few new characters from new york were great too i¡¦m not going to say who but the neighbour was one of my favourite characters in still mei feel like there doesn¡¦t need to be another book after this lou seems like she¡¦s in a great place from where the book ended i¡¦m happy to leave her there i¡¦ll definitely miss reading about what lou and her family are getting up to but i feel like a fourth book would drag it oni have loved the me before you seriestrilogy whatever it is and i love lou her parents and willif you haven¡¦t read these books then i definitely recommend them especially for the characters and how funny they are   more                  
3,                          it definitely wasn¡¦t perfect but i enjoyed hearing about how louisa¡¦s life unfolded i also especially enjoyed the stories of the people she encountered in new york stayed up way too late finishing this

5,                          wow as soon as i started reading this book i got goosebumps because it was just so thrilling to be back in louisa clarks world once again this book starts in such a fun way with lou at border control about to enter the usa everything she is doing and feeling is so relatable and instantly you remember why you love her as a character so much there are so many classic louisa moments in this book from genuine moments of honestly an heart to moments of insecurity and some really clumsy and or  wow as soon as i started reading this book i got goosebumps because it was just so thrilling to be back in louisa clarks world once again this book starts in such a fun way with lou at border control about to enter the usa everything she is doing and feeling is so relatable and instantly you remember why you love her as a character so much there are so many classic louisa moments in this book from genuine moments of honestly an heart to moments of insecurity and some really clumsy and or drunken mishaps she is a great character and i am so pleased that jojo moyes has decided to bring her back for a third time long live louisa clark of course there are some new characters to meet in this book as well and most of them just happen to be new yorkers which is great fun to read about as well but what jojo moyes has done is recognise that there are so many people from so many other countries who live in this city and the characters really reflect this i think she made a really good choice here fear not we get to catch up with louisas lovely family as well when we got to hear from them through phone calls and visits it really did feel like i was speaking to home as well these characters have been so brilliantly written to feel like family to the reader as much as to louisa then there is the fact that the majority of this book is set in manhattan i loved seeing the city through louisas eyes and visiting places with her that i have visited myself it has that little bit of devil wears prada about it because obviously louisa is new to the city but must find her way around and get into the rhythm of new york so that she can get on with her new job and there are some very funny moments that come out of this one of my favourite things is that she frequently stumbles across the difference between purse and handbag something that i can really relate to and something im glad was included in this book in terms of the plot i would say that this the third in the series is a little more upbeat than the previous two novels and the plot is therefore a little slower in pace it is very much all about louisas new start and i loved the fact that jojo moyes keeps it simple and really does focus in on that she doesnt go too far into the ins and outs of the consequences of visas and plane fares and that makes for a real escapist read the plot certainly did keep me turning the pages though as i listened to this audiobook in one day only stopping it once when i had to call in at that libraryall in all this book was just fantastic i really dont even think you would need to have read the other two books in the series in order to enjoy this book because it is definitely a story in itself about a wonderfully optimistic english woman making a life for herself in a fabulous new city and everything that comes with it i feel satisfied and comforted having finished the book i feel like i have lived through the experience with louisa and i am ready to go right back to the beginning and start it all again   more

2,                          when it comes to unnecessary sequels it seems like after you wasnt enough and there was the need to continue showing us louisas lifethis book was mainly disappointing as i considered it a superfluous addition to the series it was going to take something really good to make me like it and this didnt make it after louisa gets out of her miserable state after wills death and finds love again her story was for all intents and purposes finished bearing in mind that these are romance books  when it comes to unnecessary sequels it seems like after you wasnt enough and there was the need to continue showing us louisas lifethis book was mainly disappointing as i considered it a superfluous addition to the series it was going to take something really good to make me like it and this didnt make it after louisa gets out of her miserable state after wills death and finds love again her story was for all intents and purposes finished bearing in mind that these are romance books i understand this book in the way that it gave louisa some professional realization instead of settling for the new love interest as the ultimate happy ending and i respect it however at some point this book is full of overused tropes and introduces two love triangles to create some tension between the new happy couple and i couldnt take it seriously its the country girl in the big city story even though lou supposedly has traveled for a year so life in the city shouldnt be so alien to her the poor girl in the rich household story again with the mean rich people who treat their staff like objects lou is still a naive stupid girl who lets herself be dragged into grave and life ruining situations without trying to defend herself and im not sure if thats supposed to show how good and kind she is because to me it only displays her lack of common senseof course in the end she gets her perfect happy ending with the love of her life and her perfect job in her perfect city and i hope this time its for real we should have moved on from this story two books agothis review and others also available on my blog   more

4,                          i¡¦m not sure if it needed to be a trilogy but i tore through it just the same i have a soft spot for louisa clark and would likely read a 4th i appreciate a female lead a lead that struggles to find who she is at any stage of her life but always pushes outside her comfort to be come stronger
